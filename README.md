# MODAL USING JS ONLY

Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!
Often,we use third-party libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap to do this but as you will see,it's actually not hard to do it with vanilla Javascript.


In this project ,I have created a  Modal dialog box, through which you can alter your Description/Text and changed/altered description will reflected to website.

It covers topics like :
 1) DOM manipulation (methods I use....)
	* createElement()
	* remove()
	* appendChild()
	* addEventListener()
	* setAttribute()
 2) Basic CSS  for styling modal
 


### Need help?

```Javascript
  if (needHelp === true) {
     var emailId = "mayurkeswani2001@gmail.com";
     // email is the best way to reach out to me.
     sendEmail(emailId);
  }
```
